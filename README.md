# Blackjack
### A Blackjack simulator game using Javascript, CSS, HTML (first GA Web Dev Immersive project)

This was the first of four projects from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. We had to make a game from scratch using only Javascript (and HTML/CSS, of course). I chose blackjack. It was super fun to make!
